### Recalculate Totals

From time to time the post totals for a forum may become out of sync with reality. This can be caused by forums being deleted, posts being moved, etc. An admin option to recalculate the totals has been provided to keep the numbers up to date.

To use it:

# Select **Recalculate Totals** from the Administration Control Panel
# Click on Update Totals to perform the update

The recalculation should only take a minute to two at most. When completed you can return to the home page and the forum totals and statistics panel will be updated with the current values.
