### Get Involved
The SharePoint Forums Web Part is a community project. While it was created by one person (me), I look forward to opening it up and having anyone contribute to it.

Initially I'm going to ask that if you are planning to contribute, you'll need to provide new features (in the form of patches) before the codebase will be opened up to you for write access. This is to ensure the codebase doesn't start going off in all kinds of directions at the start. More information and details about this will be updated here.

For information on joining the project, please see the general information [here](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=CodePlex&title=How%20Can%20I%20Join%20a%20Project?) on joining a project. Alternately, you can just send me an [email](mailto:bsimser@shaw.ca) with your request.
