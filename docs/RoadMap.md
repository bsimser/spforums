This roadmap comprises the features selected for implementation in future versions of SharePoint Forums. The list includes only the most noteworthy features. Of course we will also address many more smaller ones. If you want to let us know that one of the minor features is important for you, please find and vote for it (or create it) in our issue tracker.

Please note that not all of the mentioned features will be included in the final release. While we strive to deliver as many new features as possible, we prefer to deliver less but maintain the quality high.

We want to hear your feedback on these or missing features, do not hesitate to drop us a line.
